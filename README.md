# ✅ Quodo

**Quodo** is a clean, focused to-do app built with **React**.  

Designed for simplicity, Quodo helps you stay on top of your tasks by giving you a clear queue of what to do next — no distractions, no clutter.

**This project is part of my journey to strengthen my React skills through hands-on learning and building.**
